## 1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance web applications.

Node.js is commonly used for web server development, API development, real-time applications, and more.

## 2. Getting Started

Before you dive into Node.js, make sure you have it installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).

To check if Node.js is installed, open your terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
```

You should see the version number displayed.

## 3. Basic Concepts

- **JavaScript**: Node.js uses JavaScript, so having a basic understanding of JavaScript is essential. If you're new to JavaScript, consider learning it alongside Node.js.

- **npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is the package manager for Node.js. It allows you to install and manage packages (libraries) for your Node.js projects. Learn how to use it with `npm --help` or visit the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

## 4. Modules

Node.js uses a module system to organize code. Core modules are built-in, and you can create your own custom modules. CommonJS is the module system used by Node.js.

- **Core Modules**: Node.js provides a set of core modules for common tasks. Some examples include `fs` (File System), `http` (HTTP server), and `path` (Path utilities).

- **Custom Modules**: You can create your own modules and use them in your applications. Learning how to create and use modules is fundamental.

## 5. File System

Node.js allows you to work with the file system, enabling you to read, write, and manipulate files.

- `fs` Module: Learn how to use the `fs` module to work with files and directories.

## 6. Asynchronous Programming

Node.js is designed to be non-blocking and asynchronous, which is crucial for handling many concurrent connections efficiently. Understanding asynchronous programming is essential.

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/Await

## 7. HTTP Server

Node.js can be used to create HTTP servers. You can build RESTful APIs, web servers, and more.

- `http` Module: Learn how to create a basic HTTP server using Node.js.

## 8. Express.js

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies building web applications and APIs by providing a set of useful features and middleware.

- Install and set up Express.js.
- Create routes and handle HTTP requests.

## 9. Database Integration

Node.js can connect to various databases, including MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. Learn how to integrate Node.js with your preferred database system.
